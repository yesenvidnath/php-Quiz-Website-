                    <h3><strong>4. Streaming Applications</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        Streaming applications facilitate on-demand downloading of app components without straining servers. NodeJS's native streams, offering writable and readable interfaces, are ideal for creating streaming apps. These
                        stream instances function like Unix pipes, transmitting executable code segments to machines. As connections form for new components, streaming apps download efficiently.

                    <h3><strong>5. Real-Time Collaboration Tools</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        Real-time collaboration tools encompass video conferencing, document editing, and more. NodeJS's event-driven architecture and asynchronous nature make it a prime candidate for such tools. Instant requests and events
                        occur concurrently, allowing multiple users to collaborate seamlessly across devices. NodeJS promptly updates the collaborative environment through push notifications, maintaining a coherent application
                        representation.
                    </p>

                    <h3><strong>6. Micro-Service Architecture Development</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        Micro-service architecture, seen in applications like Facebook and Netflix, partitions monolithic apps into micro-services. NodeJS supports the creation of micro-services and APIs for enhanced connectivity.
                        Frameworks like Koa and Express simplify server setup and routing, as exemplified by PayPal's successful utilization of NodeJS for its micro-service architecture.

                    <h3><strong>Netflix is the epitome of streaming media and on-demand media.</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        Being a data-driven platform, it extensively uses A/B testing to cater to a rich and seamless user experience for its millions of subscribers. However, the catch was that its app scalability and conditional
                        dependencies degraded the vast number of packages per push cycle. This made the company switch to NodeJS, which eventually made it more efficient.
